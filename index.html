            <h2 class="section-title">Why <span class="highlight">Moon 52</span> Exists</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Moon 52 begins with an old thought experiment / urban myth: if you fold a piece of paper again and again, you are only 52 folds away from the paper being as thick as the distance to the moon.</p>
                <p>At first, nothing looks different. After three folds, it still fits in your wallet. After five, the progress still feels pretty insignificant.</p>
                <p>But something is happening.</p>
                <p>Each fold builds on the last. Momentum compounds. The paper becomes harder to fold, but folds also becomes more significant. The escalating difficulty is not because you're failing, but because you're growing, and ultimately it's a demonstration of the power of compounding effort and work.</p>
                <p>That's what entrepreneurship feels like.</p>
                <p>The early stages of building a business rarely come with instant results. The work is demanding, the progress can be quiet, and most people stop before the breakthrough becomes visible.</p>
                <p>Moon 52 exists for the founders who keep going.</p>

            <div class="about-finale">
                <p>But here is the real real. 52 folds is a myth. At 52 theoretical folds of a standard piece of A4 paper, you're barely 10% of the way to the Moon, yet at the same time, only 4 more folds away. Close but still so far.</p>
                <p class="finale-highlight">Do you know what makes us love this even more? Because at that point, you then realise it was never really about getting to the Moon. It was just about making the folds.</p>

                <p>Moon52 are consultancy partners for small business owners and early-stage founders who want more than motivation - they want a roadmap, accountability, and real execution support.</p>
                <p>We combine strategic thinking of management consultancy with the hands-on energy of an incubator to help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clarify your business model</li>
                    <li>Build sustainable revenue systems</li>
                    <li>Strengthen operations and decision-making</li>
                    <li>Scale with structure, not chaos</li>
                    <li>Reach your first £1 million turnover with confidence</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We could be right for you if</strong> – you are an established and trading, but early stage, founder led service business that has an annual turnover of under £300k, looking to build and scale to £1m annually.</p>
                <p><strong>How we work</strong> – Every business is unique, but after an initial consult to see if we are suitable partners, we typically stage a 2 day workshop to dive deep in to how your business currently operates. Following this we would agree a list of real, measurable goals and outcomes to set your business on the right path, and assist with play by play execution and support, normally in the form of set consultancy hours per month or quarter, depending on the goals set.</p>
